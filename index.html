<font size ="4">

Luigi Caccia Dominioni was born in 1913 in Milan, where he graduated in architecture in 1936. In the same year he began practising in partnership with Livio and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni and together with them he developed a reputation as a pioneer of industrial design. Their collaboration resulted in some particularly important projects of a series of radio sets for Phonola and a wide research on cutlery. His 'Caccia' cutlery range comes from this research and is on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. From 1950 to 1980 he designed numerous buildings in Italy and across Europe - the Viboldone monastery, the churches of St. Biagio at Monza, the housing estates at San Felice in Milan and at Monticello, the Parc San Roman skyscraper in Monaco. He also reconstructed the Poldi Pezzoli Museum in Milan. In the '50s he set up, together with Gardella and Corradi, Azucena which is a collection of the furniture and objects he designed. </p>

<p>Without a doubt, the entire work of Luigi Caccia Dominioni is based on the principle of synthesis. The design of the furnishings and fittings is always in close harmony with the structure of the interior. Thus, for example, the mosaics by Francesco Somaini are an integral component of the overall composition of the building, which is seen as a complex organism. Caccia has explained on several occasions that he primarily sees himself someone who designs whole complexes. The draft of the plan, which in his logic follows the movements of people, gives rise to considerations that are channelled into the facade design. A further spin-off of this process are ideas for the design of objects, furnishings, accessories, lamps, handles and doors - designs that received the Compasso d'Oro award in 1985. Such ideas embrace a permanent exchange between the private and public spheres. These two areas are both tackled with equal intensity, whereby particular attention is given to the spatial quality of the axes and transitions, to corridors in private apartments, to public galleries in large buildings, to stairways and linking elements. One example of the latter is the link, built in 1968-70, between the San Fedele church and the Chase Manhattan Bank of the BBPR in the centre of Milan - which is pure genius.</p>

<p>To meet the demand for the furniture and products he designed and restored, he teamed up with Ignazio Gardella, Corrado Corradi Dell'Acqua, Maria Teresa and Franca Tosi in 1947 to co-found Italy's first business for the production and sale of objects and items of furniture: Azucena.

The Italian company Azucena was not so much a range of modern furniture with avant-garde appeal than an assortment of isolated design items that emerged after a long design phase and were intended to furnish the interiors of the new buildings. It was only in a second phase that the collection was wrought into a modern range of furnishings, that - fifty years on - now certainly has to be seen as an important chapter of Italian design history. It is immediately apparent from the collection that it had more than one root and was almost always designed around some concept of architectural space. 

Experimentation, elegance, scale, essential nature and inventiveness: these concepts characterise the items that Azucena designed - always working towards an interior design concept to which the items relate in terms of their conceptual and objective intensity. "Azucena", states Marco Romanelli, "is a symbol for a certain type of project development which is characteristic of improved, Italian design - a project development which is always rooted in the dimension of interior design or understands this as its core. It is a control possibility and a fantasy which simultaneously lead from the environment to the object and from the object to the environment."

Named for its  base made for supporting extra-large tops, this dining table has a rare brilliance. The round version has a diameter of 180 or 190 cm and the oval is wide or as Caccia put it "fat" (160 x 210 cm). The polyester gloss lacquer reduces light absorbency making the top into a yellow (or black) reflective mirror. The 16 cm-high steel band on the base protects the table from scuffing and above all, on account of the material and its inclination with respect to the floor, adds a mirrored surface that multiplies the effects of the light. Also in the version with the mahogany top with black gloss lacquered rounded edge, the Base Quadra is one of the many pieces designed by Luigi Caccia Dominioni that emanates indirect light.

One of a set of usually three or four small tables that are graduated in size so that they can slide or stack on top of one another (for space-saving storage when not in use). Each table has its own feet that rest on the floor so the next table is able to fit right above.
The ball motif was a common element in Hoffmann’s designs (see: Sitzmaschine) – the two sets of four balls on either side of the outer apron act as handles for carrying; they are decorative and functional at the same time.

Augarten porcelain is famous for its delicate and appealing shapes.This graceful "Melon" coffee service was designed by Josef Hoffmann in 1929.
The characteristic design of the shape of the coffee cup standing on four upright feet is combined with the graphic Art Deco ornamentation. It is a design that was far ahead of its time, both because of its unusual visual characteristics and the difficulties involved in the production.
